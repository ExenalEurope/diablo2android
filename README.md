Diablo 2 on android, using eltechs exagear (took me days, to find it working for Android 10)

⚠️ Main Files missing due to Copyright and file size, to play:

1. Make a folder called 'com.eltechs.ed'
2. Make a file called main.30.com.eltechs.ed.obb
3. Obb should contain wine linux (with usr/games/Diablo II) where you place Diablo 2 game files.

Install, then proceed to Setup (part 2)

# Setup (Part 2)
1. Open APK install it.
2. Go to Android -> Obb and place the folder into there.
3. Open the app, let it unpack (the obb folder that you placed).
   If you didnt do 2nd step, app launch fails.
